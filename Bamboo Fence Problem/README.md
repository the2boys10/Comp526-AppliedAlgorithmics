# Bamboo Fence Problem

This problem was aimed to solve the bamboo fence problem where we may cut 2 bamboos in one day instead of 2 and was solved using Java.

## Running the tests

Each bamboo fence problem set can be ran on its own and already uses the optimal perqueue however if you would like to expand on the solution you can retrieve a different perqueue using the Discovery program, simply change the growth rates and you will find a perqueue that is relevant to your problem.
